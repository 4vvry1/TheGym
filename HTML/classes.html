                Body building is building and shaping muscles through exercise, nutrition, and discipline
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                Bodybuilding is a form of physical training and lifestyle focused on developing and sculpting the body's muscles through resistance exercises, proper nutrition, 
                and discipline. It involves structured workouts, often with weights or machines, that target different muscle groups to increase muscle size (hypertrophy), strength, 
                and definition. Beyond the gym, bodybuilding emphasizes a balanced diet rich in protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats to fuel workouts, promote recovery, 
                and support muscle growth. Many bodybuilders also follow strict routines that include rest and recovery since muscles grow and repair during downtime.
            </p>

            <p class="content">
                For some, bodybuilding is a competitive sport where athletes present their physiques on stage, judged on muscle mass, symmetry, proportion, and conditioning. 
                For others, it's a personal journey of self-improvement, boosting confidence, discipline, and overall health. At its core, bodybuilding is not just about building muscle 
                but also about cultivating mental resilience, dedication, and consistency in pursuing a strong, healthy, and aesthetically developed body.

            <p class="subtitle">Pilates strengthens the core and improves flexibility through controlled movements.</p>
            <p class="content">
                Pilates is a full-body exercise method and lifestyle practice focused on strengthening
                the core, improving flexibility, and enhancing posture through controlled movements and
                mindful breathing. It emphasizes precision, concentration, and flow in every exercise, making it not only a physical workout 
                but also a mental discipline that connects the body and mind. Pilates can be performed on a mat using body weight or with specialized 
                equipment, such as the reformer, which adds resistance and support to deepen the effectiveness of each movement.
            </p>
            
            <p class="content">
                Beyond physical strength, Pilates promotes balance, coordination, and mobility, which makes it beneficial for injury prevention, rehabilitation, and daily functional movements. 
                It encourages body awareness, helping individuals move more efficiently and with better alignment in their everyday lives. For some, Pilates is a form of mindful exercise that 
                reduces stress and supports overall well-being, while for others, it serves as a complementary practice to enhance performance in sports and other fitness activities. At its core, 
                Pilates is not just about toning muscles, but about cultivating control, stability, and harmony in both body and mind.

            <p class="subtitle">Calisthenics is a bodyweight-based exercise that builds strength, flexibility, and control through natural movements.</p>
            <p class="content">
                Calisthenics is a form of physical training that relies on body weight movements to build strength, endurance, flexibility, and coordination. It focuses on natural motions such as pushing, 
                pulling, squatting, jumping, and balancing, making it a versatile and accessible workout that can be done almost anywhere without the need for equipment. Exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, 
                dips, squats, lunges, and planks are the foundation of calisthenics, and they can be scaled to suit both beginners and advanced athletes. More experienced practitioners often incorporate dynamic 
                skills and static holds—such as handstands, muscle-ups, and planches—to further challenge the body and showcase control.
            </p>
            
            <p class="content">
                Beyond building muscle and endurance, calisthenics enhances functional strength, mobility, and body awareness, making everyday movements easier and safer. It promotes discipline, creativity, and progression, 
                as individuals continuously push their limits by mastering harder variations of movements. For some, calisthenics is a sport and art form, blending strength with skill in freestyle routines, while for others, 
                it is simply a practical way to stay fit and healthy. At its core, calisthenics is not just about exercise, but about harnessing one's own body to develop power, control, and resilience in both physical ability 
                and mental focus.
